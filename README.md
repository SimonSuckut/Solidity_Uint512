# uint512 ‚Ä¢ [![tests](https://github.com/abigger87/femplate/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/abigger87/femplate/actions/workflows/tests.yml) [![lints](https://github.com/abigger87/femplate/actions/workflows/lints.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/abigger87/femplate/actions/workflows/lints.yml) ![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/abigger87/femplate)  ![GitHub package.json version](https://img.shields.io/github/package-json/v/abigger87/femplate)

This project demonstrates uint512 representation and arithmetic for the solidity language (which is limited to 2**256). It comes with an example implementation, as well as tests.


### Arithmetic Support

* Addition (512 + 512 ‚Üí 512)

* Subtraction (512 - 512 ‚Üí 512), 

* Multiplication (256 √ó 256 ‚Üí 512), (512 √ó 256 ‚Üí 512)

* Division (512 / 256 ‚Üí 256) 

* Square root (256 ‚Üí 256) and (512 ‚Üí 256). 



**NOTE:** All functions are gas optimized as far I know. Feel free to contribute if you know more advanced algorithms, spot possibilities for gas improvements or just want to extend the library.


### First time with Forge/Foundry?

See the official Foundry installation [instructions](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/blob/master/README.md#installation).

Then, install the [foundry](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry) toolchain installer (`foundryup`) with:
```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Now that you've installed the `foundryup` binary,
anytime you need to get the latest `forge` or `cast` binaries,
you can run `foundryup`.

So, simply execute:
```bash
foundryup
```

üéâ Foundry is installed! üéâ

### Writing Tests with Foundry

With [Foundry](https://gakonst.xyz), tests are written in Solidity! ü•≥

Create a test file for your contract in the `src/tests/` directory.

For example, [`src/Greeter.sol`](./src/Greeter.sol) has its test file defined in [`./src/tests/Greeter.t.sol`](./src/tests/Greeter.t.sol).

To learn more about writing tests in Solidity for Foundry and Dapptools, reference Rari Capital's [solmate](https://github.com/Rari-Capital/solmate/tree/main/src/test) repository largely created by [@transmissions11](https://twitter.com/transmissions11).

### Configure Foundry

Using [foundry.toml](./foundry.toml), Foundry is easily configurable.

For a full list of configuration options, see the Foundry [configuration documentation](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/blob/master/config/README.md#all-options).

### Install DappTools

Install DappTools using their [installation guide](https://github.com/dapphub/dapptools#installation).
